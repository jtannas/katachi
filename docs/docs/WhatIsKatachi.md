# What is Katachi?

This tool is all about defining the shape of your data.

I built it to be as approachable and easy-to-use as possible.

Keeping with the approachable feel, the usual words of schema, definition, or validator all felt too formal. Since Ruby originated in Japan, I looked up the Japanese word for shape. It came back as 形 (katachi).

I went searching for prior usage so that I wasn't duplicating a package name. The following quote came back in one of the first results:

> The word “katachi” is a composite of “kata” (pattern) and “chi” (magical power), thus it includes meanings such as “complete form” or “form telling an attractive story.” It can reveal the relationship between shape, function and meaning.

It felt like a perfect fit.
